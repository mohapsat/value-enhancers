# Guidelines on how to contribute:

- Fork the project. 
    - Forking the project creates a personal copy which will appear in your GitHub profile. To fork a project on GitHub simply click the Fork button on the top-right corner of a project page.
- Clone the forked project
    - To clone a forked project go to the repositories section of your GitHub profile and open it. There you can click on the “clone or download” button to get the address to clone.
- Set up your cloned fork
- Add your contribution
    - Make sure to pull changes from upstream (the original project) frequently or at least before pushing your changes to origin (your fork). That will force you to fix any possible conflict before submitting your pull request to the project.
- Create a pull request   
    - Once you finished to work on your contribution it’s time to push it to your forked repository on GitHub. Now go back to your forked project on GitHub in your browser and you will find a new button at the top of the page to create a pull request. Click the button and you will get a new page which contains all the information on your pull request and where you can submit it to this project.
    - Before finalising the pull request make sure to have checked everything is fine.
